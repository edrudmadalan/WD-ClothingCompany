## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
Description of the project in details.

Guiding Question:
- What is the project
    -The project is a responsive website created entirely using Tailwind CSS to represent the local brand, Charlotte Folk. The website aims to embody the brand's identity through clean design, bold typography, and subtle animations, while maintaining a visually cohesive aesthetic. It will serve as a digital space to showcase the brand’s offerings, share its story, and foster a stronger connection with its audience.
  
- Whats the purpose
    -Promote Local Talent: Provide visibility to local artists and their contributions to the clothing designs.
    -Support Local Economy: Encourage the community to support locally made products.
    -Showcase Streetwear Culture: Highlight unique designs that reflect the local streetwear style and culture.
    -E-Commerce: Enable customers to browse and purchase products easily online.
    -Brand Storytelling: Communicate the brand’s mission and the collaborative process with artists.

- What are key components
    -The website includes several key components. A hero section will introduce users to the brand with a visually engaging background carousel or video, accompanied by bold headers and compelling calls to action. The about section will narrate the brand’s story and mission, while a product showcase will highlight offerings in an organized and interactive gallery format. Social media links will be featured prominently in a contact section, enabling seamless engagement with platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. A responsive navigation bar ensures smooth usability across devices, and call-to-action buttons strategically placed throughout the site will drive user interaction. The design will leverage Charlotte Folk’s unique typography and color palette to maintain consistency with the brand’s visual identity.
  
- What technology used and how it is used
      -The website is built entirely using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first framework that simplifies styling and responsiveness. Tailwind’s predefined classes will be used to style all components, such as bg-cover for images, text-xl for typography, and hover:bg-blue-500 for interactive elements. Responsive design is achieved through Tailwind’s sm:, md:, and lg: utilities, ensuring the site is optimized for different screen sizes. Tailwind’s theme.extend configuration will allow customization of the color palette and typography to reflect Charlotte Folk’s branding. The structure is defined using HTML, with semantic tags like header and footer for better organization and SEO. Smooth transitions and animations will be implemented using Tailwind’s transition and transform utilities. Additionally, the hero section may feature a video background or carousel to capture user attention. Accessibility enhancements, such as the use of sr-only classes, will ensure inclusivity for all users. Together, these technologies create a functional, aesthetic, and engaging platform for Charlotte Folk.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.
